   "sp_description": "A concept has been developed in an international patent by a start-up company called Zambelli Imagineering Pty Ltd, which has been founded by my parents. This patent concept introduces drone landing stations in residential areas and city centres to allow aerial autonomous vehicle (AAV) travel to transport passengers.\nI would like to further the concept from the patent, and develop the mechatronic systems as follows:\n- ordering of a drone from a smart phone to come to the nearest available drone station\n- portable residential drone landing station\n- High rise building drone landing station\nThe mechatronic systems development will require the learnings from my second and third year engineering units to come up with a solution. I will also be able to draw on the experiences I have gained at two internships with robotics and automation companies over the last 3 years.",

We will be guided in this by unpublished work that creates a framework in which to understand various pattern matching implementations.  We hypothesise that PureScript has some genuinely innovative features and expect to be able to illuminate their operation via this method.  It is hoped that other languages would then have a path to implementing the innovative features of pattern matching found in PureScript.",

   "sp_description": "We take a novel problem description and research possible optimal solutions to the problem.  The problem description is ‚Äúwe require an unmanned surface vehicle, which can carry a variety of sensors (both under and above water).  The vehicle must be controlled by two independent propulsion systems, both with rudders and will be capable of ‚Äúskid steering‚Äù.  The vehicle must minimise disturbance that will affect the sensors even during manoeuvring.  The vehicle must be large enough to carry the sensors (approximately 2m).  Sensor disturbances to be minimised are (at least):\n  * underwater turbulence at the sensor sites\n  * pitch and roll\n  * unexpected acceleration\n\nIt is desirable to be able to travel both quickly (without concern for disturbance) as well as at a slower speed when minimal disturbance is desired\nIn this project we will work on _hull design_ for this problem statement.  We will assume solutions to the propulsion and guidance problems.\n\nWe hope to achieve field trials to demonstrate the extent to which each characteristic has been achieved.",
