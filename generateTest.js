UV-light increases the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin which is an essential compound for many metabolic processes.

There are three types of classified UV radiation according to their wavelength including UVA, UVB and UVC. Among all the rays, UVC has the shortest wavelength and is the most dangerous one but these rays do not reach the earth‚Äôs surface as they are completely absorbed by the ozone layer. However, both UVA and UVB reach the earth‚Äôs surface and play an important role in conditions such as premature skin aging, eye damage, and skin cancers\nThis project aims to fabricate a new generation of highly responsive wearable sensors which can be easily attached our smart watches and can measure the UV dosage absorbed by our skin to improve sun safety and prevent skin cancer.',

    p_description:
      'One of the overarching goals of cryptocurrencies was to provide complete anonymity of all parties involved in a financial transaction, in a manner similar to what is achieved in a cash based transaction. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin partially achieve this via the use of pseudonymous transactions, but the public record of transactions on the blockchain may result in re-identification via network or graph analysis. As a result, there are many privacy enhancing techniques such as the use of mixers (or tumblers), or entire cryptocurrencies such as Zcash built on encrypted blockchains using advanced zero-knowledge protocols from cryptography (zk-SNARKs).\n\nThe high-level of privacy makes it hard to trace transactions to real-world identities. This undoubtedly has some societal benefits, such as enabling people to send donations to human rights organisations in oppressed regimes. However, at the same time this also enables criminals such as money launderers, ransomware writers, drug and human traffickers to erase their online trace making it hard for law enforcement to attribute criminal activities to individuals.\n\nThe goal of this project is to analyse the security properties of anonymity techniques used in modern cryptocurrencies such as mixers and zk-SNARKs. The project will investigate technique(s) that could potentially de-anonymize end-to-end transactions.',

This virtualisation allows multiple containers/applications to run on the same set of resources in a single physical machine. It is also a key enabling technology for cloud computing. However, the reality is that co-located applications compete for resources and interfere with each other‚Äôs performance, resulting in performance variability/degradation. The impact of performance degradation can vary from a minor delay in loading a web page to a significant loss in revenue and sales. Many existing solutions to this either concrete or reactive. In this project, we aim to develop a self-adjusting resource allocation technique that enables resources (CPU, memory and disk) to be virtualised in a non-uniform\nfashion and at fine granularity for application diversity, and applications are co-located with their access to resources being considerate to each other. The framework of the techinque has been developed already. We are particularly interested in the application of this technique to modern machine learning applications.',

    p_description:
      'Working with lasers can be extremely hazardous and strict safety guidelines must therefore be adhered to. In most cases, the primary risk is to eyesight, meaning that laser users must wear appropriate laser-safety goggles. Traditionally these goggles are based on passive optical filters and only work over a limited specific wavelength range, meaning different goggles are needed for each different laser user. This leads to high costs, and safety challenges in laboratories that need to run multiple types of laser simultaneously. This project aims to achieve a universal solution to laser eye safety by development of active goggles using cameras and screens, such as those used in modern VR headsets. If implemented correctly, a single pair of goggles will then be able to protect against a broad range of laser types. The project may have multiple students working on it with the work being broken up into distinct areas.',

Particle swarm optimization is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with respect to a measure of quality.  It solves the problem by having a number of candidate solutions, called particles, and moving these particles around in the search space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particles position and velocity.  Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best solution but is also guided toward the best-known solution in the search space, which is updated as better positions are found by other particles.  The processes move the swarm of solutions towards the optimal solution for the problem, which is the optimal clustering solution.",

      "The (fictitious, at the moment) start-up company Bedrock Photonics is developing gas sensors based on custom optical fibres that are fragile and expensive. The optical fibre requires the precise preparation of the fibre ends using our sophisticated optical fibre polishing and cleaving equipment. As part of the company's quality control process, the ends of the fibres must be inspected before they are installed into the laser systems and they must be inspected if the fibres have failed in use. This project will setup up a specially designed horizontal microscope that we have obtained that inspects the fibres once they are mounted on a uniquely designed (by the project) platform. The project will develop the image capturing software and precise motion control system to establish the quality of the end of the fibre and setup up the overall system.",

However, the amplifier at a high-power level becomes non-linear.  An artificial neural network can be trained to create a function which is an inverse function to the input-output function of the non-linear amplifier.  The cascade combination of the neural network and the amplifier creates a close to linear amplifier.  The linear amplifier allows multi-carrier transmission of digitally modulated signals through the satellite repeater with low bit error rate degradation.  This project investigates amplifier linearization using artificial neural networks.  Neural network training software will be created using MATLAB.  The bit error rate of digitally modulated signals transmitted through the linearized amplifier will be determined.

Inorganic conductive materials such as solid metals are much stiffer than skins and clothes and have limited ductility in bulk form. Similarly, most organic electronic materials such as conducting polymers also have very limited stretchability. To render them stretchable, several strategies have been developed, including compounding the rigid conductive components with intrinsically flexible and stretchable elastomers or making electronic components in a configuration so that they experience much lower strain than the applied strain. In this study, conductive nanomaterials will be combined with elastomers to fabricate stretchable conductors. To further improve the stretchability, different structural designs will be created and compared to study the structure effects on the stretchability.',

Therefore, in this project, we aim at exploring the capability of state-of-the-art recommender systems in delivering more accurate, efficient, and explainable bundle recommendations.

Recycling and harvesting of local indoor light to generate electricity is cost effective.  \n\nIndoor lighting in buildings e.g., LEDs, provides much weaker in intensity and shorter in wavelength light than the outdoor sunlight spectrum. Thus solar cells optimised for high efficiency under outdoor conditions may not show high performance indoors. A material and device structure having outstanding performance under the indoor spectrum is required for efficient power supply to IoT devices.  \n\nThe focus of this project will be to use commercial optical simulation software to accurately model a complete perovskite device structure, based on characterisation metrics from actual devices. Once validated, the model will then be used to optimise the perovskite solar cell design to best suit conventional indoor lighting scenarios. This will include accounting for the spectrum of indoor light sources as well as investigating the solar cell response at different angles of incidence.',

    p_description:
      'Low interpretability is one of the biggest problems facing autonomous driving systems right now. In order to improve the interpretability of autonomous driving systems, researchers have tried to train deep learning models to simulate the attention areas of human drivers while driving. This work hopes to investigate whether these attention extraction models can be used to improve the performance of autonomous driving models. In the early stages of the experiment, we plan to reproduce some of the code of the open-source project. Then, we fuse the autonomous driving model with the attention extraction model and thus propose a new end-to-end model that uses attention to guide autonomous driving decisions. \nWe hope students can help us reproduce the source code of some open source projects and conduct some interesting experiments, such as modifying the network structure.',

As it seeks to reach a wider audience through various emerging platforms, questions around optimal interface solutions remain. The impact of various kinds of natural user interfaces leveraged by different headsets, including head, hand, and even eye tracking, remains unclear, along with the utility and viability of more traditional control interfaces (like dual analogue controllers). This project seeks to expand on and customise an existing software-based virtual environment, built in the Unity game engine, to explore some of these questions and compare the influence of different control interfaces on usability and player experiences in virtual reality. You will be tasked with adapting the existing software platform, currently being used to explore questions around eye tracking and agent simulation in VR, so that it supports a range of control inputs. In this work, you will need to explore design and development issues around body tracking/natural interaction with different control interfaces and the way these can be represented in a virtual environment. This project will further challenge you to undertake games user research to evaluate the influence of these different interface implementations.',

      'A relatively recent innovation in end-to-end conversational AI\nis the incorporation of personas: collections of personal facts like name, if they have a dog, personality. One approach to this is simply to train the bot with conversations where the ‚Äòbot‚Äô interlocutor exhibits a persona.

    p_description:
      "In recent years, dash cams have gained international popularity for personal and commercial use. Although dash cams are primarily used to collect evidence for traffic incidents, further value may be gained from the videos they record through video analytics. Of particular interest, object tracking can aid surveillance by highlighting and distinguishing between different vehicles and pedestrians. As commercial dash cams have limited resources, they are unable to perform computationally intensive tasks such as object tracking.\nAs a result, a dash cam must offload its video data to a machine that is capable of performing video analytics. A popular choice data offloading is cloud computing. However, cloud computing is not perfect, it is particularly unsuitable for tasks that are highly latency-sensitive. There is an inherent delay in transmitting data to a distant cloud server. In this project, we aim to develop a distributed real-time data analytics system for live-streaming dashcam video using mobile devices at the edge of the network, such as smartphones and tablets. In particular, we will develop scheduling submodules for the system, that will efficiently manage one or more mobile devices of a driver and/or passenger for detecting distraction and obstructions, such as drowsiness and roadkills. This edge-based video analytics system has been being developed by our team, and it's in the final stage of development. ",

The GEO satellite is equipped with a large number of spot beams, as well as an up-down feeder link to a ground station. The LEOs have at most only a few spot beams, but they also have high capacity inter-satellite links to enable multi-hop in space, as well as the capacity to communicate to a ground station.

However, the automated generation of testing scenarios in simulation is a challenge. First, testing scenarios are normally described in natural language or other sources like images or videos, which cannot be directly reconstructed in a simulator. Second, it is difficult to find and generate critical testing scenarios to reveal problems of Autonomous Driving Systems. To solve these questions, we plan to use knowledge graphs. A knowledge graph can clearly show a driving testing scenario and it is also readable for the computer. We can thus develop software to convert knowledge graphs to executable testing scenarios in a simulator. In addition, a knowledge graph defines a lot of parameters. By changing the values of the parameters, we can create more testing scenarios and search critical ones.',

      'The error surface of the design of IIR digital filters, involving the selection of an optimal set of filter coefficients, is nonlinear and multi-modal.  Global optimization techniques are required to avoid local error minima.  Particle swarm optimization is a powerful global optimization technique which is ideally suited for this problem.   The optimization technique can be done in MATLAB to the optimal design of digital filters which closely approximate a designed filter specification.  Software for the implementation of the particle swarm intelligence design, the evaluation of the filter transfer function, and the evaluation of the filter poles and zeros will be created in this project.  The filter design technique will be demonstrated for a number of low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-reject filters.',

    p_description:
      'Federated learning is a novel distributed machine learning framework, through which decentralized clients can collaboratively training a common model by merely exchanging parameter information with a parameter server. The parameter server aggregates the computation results submitted from clients, and then distributes aggregated results back to clients. They need to exchange parameters for multiple rounds of iterations until the model converges. However, communication via the Internet is costly. To accelerate federated learning, it is essential to reduce the communication rounds so as to improve the training efficiency. This project aims to design a model average algorithm. A client will not participate a round of global iteration unless the current model parameters are far away from its local optimal parameters so as to reduce the communication traffic volume.',

Citation count is often the key metric to gauge the quality of research, such as individual papers, conferences and journals as well as the quality of researchers, such as h-index. However, this metric has been only looked at one-dimensionally. There are several other metrics that need to be incorporated to more accurate measure such quality, such as the community size and the ratio of quality to quantity, e.g.,  A/A* publications to total publications. The student will be specially given access to the database used to maintain conference/journal rankings in Australia.',

Traditionally, this can be carried out through on-site inductions, or through interactive content and assessments.

Virtual reality may provide a solution to this, enabling scenarios to be programmed such that a trainee can gain more practical experience whilst remaining safe at all times.

      'Mixers are required for frequency conversion in radio systems; they may be realised using diodes or transistor devices fabricated in a variety of semiconductor materials. Mixers are inherently non-linear and suffer from many unwanted intermodulation products or spurious responses which can limit the dynamic range of radio systems or necessitate filtering to suppress the spurious. This occurs, in part, because a large local oscillator signal is needed in order to switch the mixing device rapidly between on and off states, but the large voltage swings may push the device close to breakdown resulting in unwanted distortion. Gallium nitride FETs might offer advantages because of their high breakdown voltage, which may help to minimise unwanted distortion',

    p_description:
      'With over 600,000 legacy mines in Australia and the USA alone, each with associated on- and offsite environmental impacts, there is an urgent and growing need to determine the extent of contamination to inform management and remediation. The extent of contamination is usually defined by chemical analyses of soil, sediment and water.\nThe current technique involved the collection of water samples (1-2 L) at a time, and then filtration using 0.45 ¬µm cellulose acetate filters. However, this technique is extremely slow and labour intensive, especially in turbid waters. In addition, only a very small volume of water (up to 50 ml) is used in each sample, which is barely represented. Thus, the development of a new filtration technique capable of sampling a large volume of water in a significantly shorter timeframe is highly desirable. ',

    p_description:
      'semiconductor die are often evaluated ‚Äúon wafer‚Äù, i.e. without being assembled into packages. Probes are used to supply RF signals and DC power to pads on the die. The DC probes typically incorporate one or more shunt capacitors or RC networks to bypass AC signals and to decouple the circuit from the power supply. However, this probe/capacitor configuration can influence the circuit electrical behaviour due to unintended resonances and sub-optimal isolation between supply pins. It is common to see different behaviour from the same circuit tested with probes compared to a hard-wired evaluation board (e.g. intermodulation asymmetry or circuit instability). So far, this problem has received little attention and the behaviour of the DC probe at baseband and microwave frequencies is poorly understood.',
